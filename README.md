# -SHOWDOWN-KNN-vs.-Perceptron-
This project will compare the three techniques we've learned on the counterfeit currency dataset. Build a model, including thoughtful feature and parameter selection, that will classify data as real or counterfeit. Be sure to separate your data into a test set and training set, and then use a development set to select parameters and features for your models (you can choose either cross-validation or a simple development set split). You can use the built-in functions for decision trees (fitctree) and k-nearest neighbors (fitcknn), but you must code the perceptron from scratch. You should also include a thorough model evaluation process, both to compare different versions of the same model (knn for different k) and also to compare two different models (e.g., knn and perceptron). For this part, you can use built in correlation and hypothesis test functions, but you should implement cross-validation, any plotting, and bootstrapping yourself.
